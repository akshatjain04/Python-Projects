Scenario 1: Positive coefficients
Given the coefficients (a, b, delta) for the function calculate_vertices is (1, 2, 3). 
We should expect the result of the function to be (-2.00, -0.75).

Scenario 2: Negative coefficients
Given the coefficients (a, b, delta) for the function calculate_vertices are (-1, -2, -3).
We should expect the result of the function to be (2.00, 0.75).

Scenario 3: Zero coefficients
Given the coefficient a in calculate_vertices is 0 and the other coefficients are arbitrary positive or negative numbers.
We should not carry out the calculation since it will result in division by zero error.

Scenario 4: Large magnitude coefficients
Given the coefficients (a, b, delta) for the function calculate_vertices is (100000, 200000, 300000)
The function should still return the result without any loss or distortion.

Scenario 5: Decimal coefficients
Given the coefficients (a, b, delta) for the function calculate_vertices is (0.1, 0.2, 0.3)
The function should still return the result correctly up to two decimal places.

Scenario 6: Test with real world example 
Given the coefficients (a, b, delta) for the function calculate_vertices is (1, -3, 2) which represents the quadratic equation "x^2 - 3x + 2".
We should expect the result of the function to be (1.5, -0.25), the vertex of the quadratic equation. 

Scenario 7: Mixed positive and negative coefficients
Given the coefficients (a, b, delta) for the function calculate_vertices is (-2, 3, -4)
We should expect the result of the function to be as calculated by the equation. The order and sign of coefficients should not distort the calculation. 

Scenario 8: No arguments provides
Given the function calculate_vertices is called with no arguments, we should expect the method to throw a TypeError.

Scenario 9: Null arguments
Given the coefficients (a, b, delta) for the function calculate_vertices are null. The function should throw an error because null values are not valid input for the calculation. 

Scenario 10: If the delta value is negative 
Given the coefficients (a, b, delta) for the function calculate_vertices is (1, 2, -3) 
The function should return a valid result as the negative delta value will just make the y-coordinate negative.
