"""
1. Happy Path Scenario: 

   Test when valid input values are passed to the function.
   
   Description:
   
   When values of a, b and c are passed as input to the function, it should return the correct delta calculation. 
   

2. Zero Coefficient Scenario:

   Test when 'a' is zero.
   
   Description:
   
   When 'a' = 0, the function should not fail as the quadratic equation becomes a linear equation.
   

3. Negative Coefficient Scenario:

   Test when coefficients 'a', 'b', and 'c' are negative.
   
   Description:
   
   The function should be able to handle negative values for 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
   

4. Complex Number Scenario:

   Test when the solution of the quadratic equation results in complex numbers.
   
   Description:
   
   When the discriminant (result of the function) is less than 0, the roots of the quadratic equation are complex numbers. The function should handle this correctly and not result in any errors.
  

5. Large Values Scenario:

   Test when very large values are provided as coefficients.
   
   Description:
   
   The function should not fail or return incorrect values when large coefficient values are used.


6. Non-Zero Coefficient Scenario:

  Test when 'a' is a non-zero number.
  
  Description:
  
  The function is designed to calculate the discriminant of a quadratic equation, which requires a non-zero 'a'. The function should return the correct calculation.

7. One Coefficient Zero Scenario:

   Test one coefficient is zero.
   
   Description:
   
   It could be possible that any one of 'b', 'a' or 'c' is zero, in that case function should correctly calculate the delta.


8. All Coefficients Zero Scenario:

   Test when all coefficients are zero.
  
   Description:
  
   All coefficients can be zero, in this scenario function should return zero as zero is a valid number for the quadratic equation.
   

9. Decimal Coefficient Scenario:
  
   Test when coefficients are decimal numbers.
   
   Description:
  
   Function should correctly calculate delta for decimal inputs.
