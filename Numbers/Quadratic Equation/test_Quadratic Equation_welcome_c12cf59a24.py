# Test generated by RoostGPT for test MiniPythonProjects using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

"""
1. Basic Operation: The first scenario should be a normal operation of the function to ensure it prints as expected, without any errors.
    - Input: None
    - Expected Outcome: The user is greeted with a welcome message and given instructions on the next steps.

2. Empty Input: Test the behavior of the function when called without the required parameters. This should not affect this as no parameters are required in this function, but we must make sure there is not invisible dependency.
    - Input: None
    - Expected Outcome: The message is printed as intended.

3. Repeated Calls: The function behavior should be consistent when called multiple times consecutively, this would check for session-like or stateful behavior, ensure there are no unwanted side effects affecting the internal state.
    - Input: None
    - Expected Outcome: Consistency in printed messages across multiple function calls.

4. Redirection of Standard Output: Check operation of the function when standard output is redirected. Validate the function's compatibility with other system parts and its ability to operate under condition of redirected standard output. 
    - Input: Redirection instructions
    - Expected Output: Function should execute without errors and printed messages should be redirected as per instructions.

5. Simultaneous Calls: Check operation of the function under simultaneous calls (multithreading), to check thread safety and consistency.
    - Input: None
    - Expected Outcome: All threads should print the message correctly, without affecting each other.

6. Exception Handling: Although this function doesn't throw any exceptions itself, the environment in which it runs may cause exceptions that we can't control. The test scenario can, therefore, include a case that evaluates how the function behaves in such a context (e.g., memory constraints).
    - Input: An environment condition causing an exception. 
    - Expected Outcome: Function should handle the exception or fail gracefully. 

Remember, at this stage we are only identifying scenarios to be used as a basis for test cases. The actual test conditions and data would be specified when each test case is written out.
