Test Scenario 1: Valid Marker Input
- Description: Test the function when a valid marker symbol is given as input.
- Input: Marker that is allowed in the game.
- Expected Outcome: The marker should be placed at the specified position on the board, and the same position should become unavailable.

Test Scenario 2: Invalid Marker
- Description: Test the function when a non-allowed symbol is given as marker input.
- Input: Marker that is not allowed in the game.
- Expected Outcome: The function either should not place the non-allowed marker on the board, or this could result in an error.

Test Scenario 3: Valid Position Input
- Description: Test the function when a valid position on board is specified.
- Input: Position that is available.
- Expected Outcome: A marker should be placed at the position on the board.

Test Scenario 4: Position Already Taken
- Description: Test the function when a position on the board that is already occupied by a marker is given as input.
- Input: Position that is not available.
- Expected Outcome: The function should not place a marker in this position, which could result in showing an error message or no operation.

Test Scenario 5: Position is Out of Bounds 
- Description: Test the function when the position provided does not exist on the board.
- Input: A position value that exceeds the index of the board.
- Expected Outcome: The function should not place a marker at that position. It could throw an error or perform no operation.

Test Scenario 6: Check if an Available Spot is Cleared
- Description: After a marker has been placed at a valid position, that position should become unavailable. 
- Input: Position where a marker has been placed.
- Expected Outcome: The position should be removed from available spots.

Test Scenario 7: Place Marker when No Positions are Available
- Description: Test the function when all positions on the board are occupied.
- Input: Board where all positions are occupied by markers.
- Expected Outcome: The function should not be able to place a marker as there is no available position. This scenario should result in an error message or no operation.
