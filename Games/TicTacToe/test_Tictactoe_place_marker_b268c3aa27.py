Test Scenario 1: 
Check if a marker properly places at the specified position on the board. After the method has been run, the board should contain the marker at the given position.

Test Scenario 2: 
Once the marker has been placed, the same position within the 'available' list should be cleared or set to empty. After placing the marker, the specified position on the 'available' data should be checked if it's ' '.

Test Scenario 3: 
Verify if the function updates 'board' and 'available' correctly when the position is already occupied. The function should ideally not replace an already existing marker; if it does, this would be a bug. 

Test Scenario 4: 
Validate the board state when a marker is placed at the edge positions (the first or last position). Verify if the function handles boundary conditions correctly.

Test Scenario 5: 
Check the function behavior if the 'position' value given is beyond the length of the board or 'available'. The function is expected to handle such scenarios without an error, but it's worth validating.

Test Scenario 6: 
Validate the function behavior when the passed position is already empty in the 'available' list. Despite the position being already empty, the function should still work as expected.

Test Scenario 7: 
Test the function using a full 'available' list to see if the function works without issues, i.e., all positions in 'available' are occupied, but a new one is supposed to be cleared.

Test Scenario 8: 
Check if the function correctly accepts and places different marker values. This is meant to confirm that the function handles different marker types and isn't only rigged for specific ones.

Test Scenario 9: 
Test the function with an entirely empty 'board' and 'available' list. While this wouldn't be a real game-like scenario, it can help test the robustness of the function.

Test Scenario 10: 
Validate if the function can effectively handle subsequent calls, i.e., filling up a board one after another without any errors. This includes positions having a marker coming after a position already marked ' '.
