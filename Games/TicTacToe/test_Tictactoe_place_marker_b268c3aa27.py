ROOST_TEST_HASH=tictactoe_place_marker_128715a066

When creating test scenarios for the `place_marker` function, you need to ensure that the function is correctly updating the board and the available positions. Here are several test scenarios:

1. **Valid Marker Placement:**
   - Scenario: Place a marker on an empty position that is available.
   - Expected Result: The board should reflect the marker at the specified position and the available position should be cleared (set to ' ').

2. **Occupied Position:**
   - Scenario: Attempt to place a marker on a position that is already occupied by another marker.
   - Expected Result: The function needs to be tested for its behavior in this case. If the business logic allows overwriting, the marker should be placed and the available position cleared. If not, the board should remain unchanged and an error might be raised or returned.

3. **Out of Bounds Position:**
   - Scenario: Attempt to place a marker on a position that is outside the bounds of the board.
   - Expected Result: The function should handle this gracefully, either by raising an error or ignoring the request, without modifying the board or available positions.

4. **Empty Position List:**
   - Scenario: Attempt to place a marker when the available positions list is empty.
   - Expected Result: The function should not alter the board and should handle the condition appropriately, potentially signaling that the game is over or the board is full.

5. **Full Board:**
   - Scenario: Attempt to place a marker on a board that is already full.
   - Expected Result: The function should recognize that there are no available positions and not attempt to place the marker. Appropriate handling such as an error message or a return value indicating the board is full should be observed.

6. **Marker Placement Consistency:**
   - Scenario: Place a marker in a position, then place a different marker in another available position.
   - Expected Result: The board should correctly reflect both markers in their respective positions without affecting each other.

7. **Clearing Available Position:**
   - Scenario: Confirm that when a marker is placed, the corresponding entry in the available positions list is cleared.
   - Expected Result: The position in the available list should be set to ' ', indicating it's no longer available.

8. **Multiple Marker Placements:**
   - Scenario: Place markers in multiple positions sequentially.
   - Expected Result: Each position on the board should contain the correct marker, and each should be cleared from the available positions.

9. **Undo Marker Placement:**
   - Scenario: Place a marker and then attempt to undo the placement by clearing the marker and restoring the available position.
   - Expected Result: The function may not support this directly, but the test could check if the board and available positions can be reverted to their previous state.

10. **Gameplay Progression:**
    - Scenario: Simulate a sequence of turns in a game by placing markers on the board in turns.
    - Expected Result: The board should correctly reflect the state of the game after each turn, with the correct markers placed and available positions updated.

Each of these scenarios would need to be translated into actual test cases with specific inputs when writing test code. They are designed to cover the various aspects of the `place_marker` function's expected behavior within the context of a Tic-Tac-Toe game.
