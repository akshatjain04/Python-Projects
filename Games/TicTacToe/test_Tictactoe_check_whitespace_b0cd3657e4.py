"""
1. Scenario: Empty board
   - Description: Test the function with an empty board. This represents the state of a new game where all of the positions are blank.
   - Input: 
     - board: A 3 x 3 list of all white spaces.
     - position: A tuple representing a position on the board, (0,0).
   - Expected Output: The function should return True as there is a white space in the provided position on the board.

2. Scenario: Board with a move
   - Description: Test the function with a board that has a single move. It tests the function's ability to identify a non-blank position.
   - Input: 
     - board: A 3 x 3 list where all but one position, such as (2,2), are white spaces.
     - position: A tuple representing the filled position on the board, (2,2).
   - Expected Output: The function should return False as there is no white space in the provided position on the board.

3. Scenario: Full board
   - Description: Check the function's performance with a fully filled board. It tests if the function correctly identifies that there are no more available spaces to make a move.
   - Input:
     - board: A 3 x 3 list where all positions are filled.
     - position: A tuple representing any position on the board, such as (1,1).
   - Expected Output: The function should return False since there are no more white spaces.

4. Scenario: Invalid position
   - Description: Test the function with an invalid position. This will test its behavior when the position is not on the board.
   - Input:
     - board: A 3 x 3 list of all white spaces.
     - position: A tuple representing a position not on the board, such as (4,2).
   - Expected Output: The function will raise an error as the position does not exist on the board.

5. Scenario: Null position
   - Description: Test the function with a null position. This examines how the function behaves with null inputs.
   - Input:
     - board: A 3 x 3 list of all white spaces.
     - position: null.
   - Expected Output: The function will raise an error since it doesn't receive a position.

6. Scenario: Board in a game
   - Description: Verify when both the X and O positions are in board. This helps in the real-time game scenario where we have both X and O in the board.
   - Input:
     - board: A 3 x 3 list containing a mix of white spaces, 'X' and 'O'.
     - position: A tuple representing any position which has white space.
   - Expected Output: The function should return True if there is white space in the given position and False if it is not.
