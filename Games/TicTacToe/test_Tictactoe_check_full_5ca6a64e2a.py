"""
Scenario 1: Full board
Description: Pass in a full board and validate that the function correctly returns True.
Test data: Use a board representation which is completely filled.

Scenario 2: Partially full board
Description: Pass in a partially full board and validate that the function correctly returns False.
Test data: Use a board representation where at least one position is empty.

Scenario 3: Empty board
Description: Test the function with an empty board and validate that the function correctly returns False.
Test data: Use a completely empty board representation.

Scenario 4: Board with incorrect markers
Description: Pass a board with markers other than space ' ' and check if the function correctly identifies it as a non-full board.
Test data: Use a board that contains characters other than the expected markers.

Scenario 5: Board with extra spaces
Description: Pass a board where there are one or more strings of consecutive spaces and check if the function correctly returns False.
Test data: Board containing more than one consecutive spaces.

Scenario 6: Board with special characters
Description: Pass a board containing special characters and validate that the function correctly identifies it as not a full board.
Test data: Board containing special characters.

Scenario 7: Single row/column full
Description: Pass an individual row or column that's full and ensure the function correctly returns False.
Test data: Individual row or column that's full.

Scenario 8: Single row/column partially full
Description: Pass an individual row or column that's partially full and ensure the function correctly returns False.
Test data: Individual row or column that's partially full.
