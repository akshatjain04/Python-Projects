ROOST_TEST_HASH=tictactoe_check_full_fa03cc7ec5

To create test scenarios for the `check_full` function, we need to consider various states of the `board` that represent different game stages of a Tic-Tac-Toe game. Here are some scenarios that can help validate the business logic:

1. **Empty Board Scenario:**
   - Test that the function returns `False` when the board is empty (all slots are ' ').

2. **Partially Filled Board Scenarios:**
   - Test that the function returns `False` when the board has a mix of empty (' ') and filled slots (with 'X' or 'O').
   - Test with different patterns of partially filled boards, including:
     - A board with only one slot filled.
     - A board with all but one slot filled.
     - A board with alternating empty and filled slots.
     - A board with a winning condition already met (three 'X' or 'O' in a row, column, or diagonal) but still with empty slots.

3. **Completely Filled Board Scenarios:**
   - Test that the function returns `True` when the board is completely filled with markers ('X' or 'O'), but no winner (a draw).
   - Test that the function returns `True` when the board is completely filled and there is a winning condition met.

4. **Invalid Board Scenarios:**
   - Test that the function behaves correctly (likely returning `False`) when the board has invalid characters or symbols other than 'X', 'O', or ' '.
   - Test that the function behaves correctly when the board has an incorrect number of slots (not equal to the size of a Tic-Tac-Toe board, which is typically 9).

5. **Board Size Scenarios:**
   - Test with a standard 3x3 board size to ensure the function works with a typical game setup.
   - Test with non-standard board sizes (if the game logic allows for this), such as 4x4, to ensure the function scales correctly.

6. **Special Character Scenarios:**
   - Test that the function handles special characters (such as tabs, newlines, etc.) as empty slots if the business logic deems them equivalent to ' '. 

7. **Data Integrity Scenarios:**
   - Test that the function does not modify the input board after the check.

8. **Performance Scenario:**
   - Test the function's performance with the largest board size allowed by the game logic to ensure it completes within acceptable time limits.

By covering these scenarios, we can ensure that the `check_full` function is thoroughly tested for the most common and edge-case situations it might encounter during the execution of a Tic-Tac-Toe game.
