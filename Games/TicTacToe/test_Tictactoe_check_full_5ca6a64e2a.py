"""
Scenario 1: All Spaces Filled 
Given the "board" list with all spaces filled with some marker, when the function is called, it should return True as there will be no empty (' ') element in the list, indicating the board is fully filled with markers. 

Scenario 2: Some Spaces Empty
Given the "board" list with some or at least one space not filled with marker, when the function is called, it should return False as there will be at least one empty (' ') element in the list, indicating that the board is not fully filled with markers.

Scenario 3: All Spaces Empty
Given the "board" list where all spaces that are still empty, when the function is called, it should return False. Even though there are no markers, it should still perceive it as not full, as there are empty spaces.

Scenario 4: Empty Board
Given an empty "board" list, when the function is called, it should return True, considering there is no ' ' character, and the board can be perceived as full of no markers. 

Scenario 5: Null or No Input
Given there is no input or null is provides as input, when the function is called, it should return True, as there are technically no empty spaces.

Scenario 6: Nested List Inputs
Given a nested list as a "board", when the function is called, it should handle it by user interpretation - if a nested list is allowed to be treated as multiple boards or just invalid input.

Scenario 7: Mixed Type List
Given a list containing a mixture of string and non-string elements as a "board", when the function is executed, it should handle and give outputs according to the business logic or interpretation.
