"""
Scenario 1: Test when there is no win condition met.
Conditions: Provide a "board" array that has no three identical "marker" characters in a line either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

Scenario 2: Test with a win condition in the first horizontal row.
Conditions: A "board" array where the first, second, and third positions contain the same "marker" character.

Scenario 3: Test with a win condition in the second horizontal row.
Conditions: A "board" array in which the fourth, fifth, and sixth positions contain the same "marker" character.

Scenario 4: Test with a win condition in the third horizontal row.
Conditions: A "board" array in which the seventh, eighth, and ninth positions share the same "marker" character.

Scenario 5: Test with a win condition in the first vertical column.
Conditions: A "board" array in which the first, fourth, and seventh positions contain the same "marker" character.

Scenario 6: Test with a win condition in the second vertical column.
Conditions: A "board" array in which the second, fifth, and eighth positions contain the same "marker" character.

Scenario 7: Test with a win condition in the third vertical column.
Conditions: A "board" array in which the third, sixth, and ninth positions contain the same "marker" character.

Scenario 8: Test with a win condition in the first diagonal line.
Conditions: A "board" array in which the first, fifth, and ninth positions contain the same "marker" character.

Scenario 9: Test with a win condition in the second diagonal line.
Conditions: A "board" array in which the third, fifth, and seventh positions contain the same "marker" character.
