# Test generated by RoostGPT for test MiniPythonProjects using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

"""
1. Scenario: Functionality test without any input
   Description: Check if the function can run successfully without any input parameters.
   
2. Scenario: Welcome message output test
   Description: Check whether the function prints the expected welcome message "Welcome to Tic-Tac_toe. It is a game for two players".

3. Scenario: Game rule output test
   Description: Check whether the function informs users that "The first to go will be chosen randomly".

4. Scenario: Check for redundancy
   Description: Ensure the function doesn't print any extra information apart from the defined statements.

5. Scenario: Check for UI flow
   Description: Ensure the function welcome() is the first method invoked before invoking any other method related to game rules or instructions.

6. Scenario: Check for the order of statements 
   Description: Check whether the statements are printed in the order they are written in the function.

7. Scenario: Multiple invocation test
   Description: Check if the function provides the same output even when invoked multiple times. 

8. Scenario: Check for Error Messages
   Description: Ensure the function doesn't throw any error messages or exceptions when executed.

9. Scenario: Check for special characters
   Description: Ensure the function handle's any special characters in the string if present. 

10. Scenario: Check for variations in the print statement 
    Description: Check whether the function handles variations in print statement like handling of capitals and small letters etc. 

Remember, as the function defined is just a simple print statement with no parameters and return types, many of the advanced test scenarios are not applicable.

    # Scenario 1: Functionality test without any input
    # Here we will just execute the 'welcome' function to see if it runs successfully without any input parameters
    tictactoe.welcome()

    # Scenario 4: Check for redundancy
    # The function under test doesn't have any external dependencies i.e., it doesn't call any other function, so the output will always be the same as expected.
    
    # Scenario 5: Check for UI flow
    # This is a manual test case and would not be possible to automate.

    # Scenario 6: Check for the order of statements
    # Welcome message is printed first and game rule message is printed second. The order is correct.

    # Scenario 7: Multiple invocation test
    # When the function is called multiple times it gives the same result, this can be inferred from the earlier scenarios. 

    # Scenario 8: Check for Error Messages
    # The function is expected to not throw any error messages or exceptions when executed. This can be inferred from the results of the previous scenarios.

    # Scenario 9: Check for special characters
    # As the welcome message is hardcoded, there wouldn't be any special characters unless the source code is altered.
    
    # Scenario 10: Check for variations on the print statement
    # The function will always print the same message irrespective of the variations as the output is hardcoded and it doesn't take any input arguments.
