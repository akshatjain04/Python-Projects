ROOST_TEST_HASH=tictactoe_welcome_4bf868470e

When writing test scenarios for the `welcome` function in a Tic-Tac-Toe game, you'll want to ensure that the function behaves as expected under various conditions. However, since the `welcome` function provided only prints messages and does not take any input or return any output, the test scenarios will be limited to verifying the behavior of the output message to the console. Here are some potential test scenarios:

1. **Test Scenario: Verify Welcome Message Display**
   - **Given**: The game is initiated.
   - **When**: The `welcome` function is called.
   - **Then**: The console should display the message "Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe. It is a game for two players".

2. **Test Scenario: Verify Random Player Selection Announcement**
   - **Given**: The game is initiated.
   - **When**: The `welcome` function is called.
   - **Then**: The console should display the message "The first to go will be chosen randomly".

3. **Test Scenario: Verify Order of Messages**
   - **Given**: The game is initiated.
   - **When**: The `welcome` function is called.
   - **Then**: The welcome message should be printed before the random player selection announcement.

4. **Test Scenario: Verify No Return Value**
   - **Given**: The game is initiated.
   - **When**: The `welcome` function is called.
   - **Then**: The function should not return any value (i.e., the return value should be `None`).

5. **Test Scenario: Verify Multiple Calls**
   - **Given**: The game is initiated and the `welcome` function has already been called once.
   - **When**: The `welcome` function is called again.
   - **Then**: The same messages should be printed each time the function is called, without any changes or additions.

6. **Test Scenario: Verify Function Documentation**
   - **Given**: The game is initiated.
   - **When**: The `welcome` function's docstring is accessed.
   - **Then**: The docstring should be present and describe the function as a welcome message.

7. **Test Scenario: Verify No Side Effects**
   - **Given**: The game is initiated and in a certain state.
   - **When**: The `welcome` function is called.
   - **Then**: The state of the game should remain unchanged after the function call.

8. **Test Scenario: Verify Output Consistency**
   - **Given**: The game is initiated and the `welcome` function is called multiple times across different game sessions.
   - **When**: The `welcome` function is called each time.
   - **Then**: The output messages should be consistent across different calls and sessions.

9. **Test Scenario: Verify Independence from Game State**
   - **Given**: The game is in various states (e.g., not started, in progress, finished).
   - **When**: The `welcome` function is called in each state.
   - **Then**: The function's output should not depend on the game state and should always print the welcome messages.

10. **Test Scenario: Verify Console Output Encoding**
    - **Given**: The game is initiated in an environment with different encoding settings.
    - **When**: The `welcome` function is called.
    - **Then**: The messages should be correctly encoded and displayed without any encoding errors.

Remember, these scenarios assume that you will be testing the output to the console and that the function does not interact with or alter any other part of the game's state. The actual implementation of these tests would depend on the test framework being used and might involve capturing standard output or using mocks.
