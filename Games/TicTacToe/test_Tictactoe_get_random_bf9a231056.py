ROOST_TEST_HASH=tictactoe_get_random_9c10907d28

To validate the business logic of the `get_random` function, which is supposed to randomly choose between 'Player 1' and 'Player 2', the following test scenarios could be considered:

1. **Randomness Test**: Ensure that the function does not always return the same player. This can be tested by running the function a significant number of times and ensuring that both 'Player 1' and 'Player 2' are returned at some point.

2. **Distribution Test**: Check if the function returns 'Player 1' and 'Player 2' with approximately equal probability. This can be done by calling the function a large number of times (e.g., 10,000 times) and verifying that the results are close to a 50/50 distribution.

3. **Boundary Test**: Verify that the function never returns anything other than 'Player 1' or 'Player 2'. This is to check that the boundaries of the random number generation are respected.

4. **Repeatability Test**: Test if the function can be called multiple times in succession without any errors or changes in behavior.

5. **State Independence Test**: Ensure that the output of the function is independent of the state of the system or the environment in which it is run. For example, it should not matter what other functions or code have been executed before calling `get_random`.

6. **Performance Test**: Check if the function returns a result within an acceptable time frame even when called a large number of times in a loop. This is to ensure that the random number generation does not introduce significant latency.

7. **Concurrency Test**: If applicable, ensure that calling the `get_random` function from multiple threads does not cause any issues or unexpected behavior.

8. **Seed Control Test**: If the function's randomness is seeded in some way (not shown in the snippet), tests should be written to ensure that when the seed is set to a known value, the sequence of 'Player 1' and 'Player 2' returned is predictable and repeatable.

9. **Error Handling Test**: Although not explicit in the code snippet, ensure that the function behaves correctly in the face of any potential errors from the `random.randint` function.

10. **Documentation/Specification Test**: Verify that the behavior of the function matches what is described in its docstring or any other associated documentation/specification.

Remember, these scenarios are about what to test, not how to implement the tests. Actual test code would be required to validate these scenarios programmatically.

# Scenario 1: Randomness Test

# Scenario 4: Repeatability Test
def test_get_random_repeatability():
    for _ in range(10):
        tictactoe.get_random()  # No assertion needed, just testing for errors

# Scenario 5: State Independence Test
# No specific test needed, as the function does not depend on any external state.

# Scenario 6: Performance Test
def test_get_random_performance(benchmark):
    # Using pytest's benchmark fixture to measure performance
    benchmark(tictactoe.get_random)

# Scenario 7: Concurrency Test
# This scenario isn't applicable as Python's GIL prevents true concurrency
# and the function doesn't use any shared state that could be affected by threads.

# Scenario 8: Seed Control Test
@patch('random.randint')
def test_get_random_seed_control(mock_randint):
    mock_randint.return_value = 1
    assert tictactoe.get_random() == 'Player 1'
    mock_randint.return_value = 2
    assert tictactoe.get_random() == 'Player 2'

# Scenario 9: Error Handling Test
# No specific test needed, as there's no error handling in the function.

# Scenario 10: Documentation/Specification Test
# This would be a manual review rather than an automated test.
