"""
1. Scenario: Utilize a number of tests to ascertain the random nature of the function.
   Expected Result: The distribution between 'Player 1' and 'Player 2' should roughly be equal after a large number of tests.

2. Scenario: Test if the function never returns anything else but 'Player 1' or 'Player 2'.
   Expected Result: The function should solely return 'Player 1' or 'Player 2' and no other outcome.

3. Scenario: If the function is called multiple times consecutively (e.g. 10 times), it should not return the same player each time. This will test the randomness of the function.
   Expected Result: The function should not always return the same player on multiple executions, proving its randomness.

4. Scenario: The function should not return a blank or null value.
   Expected Result: The returned value should be 'Player 1' or 'Player 2' and not a null or a blank value.

5. Scenario: The function should not raise exceptions when it is called.
   Expected Result: The function's execution should be seamless, not causing any Python Exceptions.

6. Scenario: The function should execute within appropriate time limits. 
   Expected Result: The function response time should be well within reasonable time limits. 

7. Scenario: Test the function when the system CPU and memory load is high to ensure function can handle system stress.
   Expected Result: Despite high system load, the function should perform as expected, not degrading its performance significantly.
