"""
1. Scenario: Tester runs the function multiple times to verify the result is "Player 1" or "Player 2". The function should return either "Player 1" or "Player 2" in an unpredictable manner as the result is expected to be random.

2. Scenario: Tester firmly checks that no other strings or characters besides "Player 1" and "Player 2" are returned. The function should only return these two specific string values and nothing else.

3. Scenario: Tester verifies that the function never returns NULL or an empty string. Since a game of tic tac toe always starts with one of the two players, the function should never return a value that does not represent one of the players.

4. Scenario: Tester runs the function tens or hundreds of times and records the results, analyze the data to confirm the function is not significantly biased towards one player. While perfect randomness can't be expected due to limitations in how random number generation works, a large enough sample should see a rough 50/50 distribution between "Player 1" and "Player 2".

5. Scenario: Tester checks that the function does not throw any exceptions and that it completes execution. There are no conditions in the function that could cause an exception, and it does not rely on any other functions that could throw exceptions, so it should always complete execution without error. 

6. Scenario: Test the function for its execution time, the function should not take too much time to generate the output. As it's a simple random number generating operation, the execution time should be minimal. 

7. Scenario: Running the function in a multi-threaded environment to check if it would still return expected results, in order to check if the function is thread-safe.
